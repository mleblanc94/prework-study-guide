This study guide can be used to take notes for all the technologies we have learned so far such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. 

The study guide features these technologies broken down into sections. In order to add to these sections, the user simply needs to clone the repository and add their own notes into the HTML.

If a user wants to check that the Javascript it working - for now, they can open the console using the Google Chrome development tools and see that the Javascript is printing results.
